# Google Places API Setup for Enhanced School Search

## üì± Overview

The enhanced school search combines **MapKit** (for finding schools) with **Google Places API** (for detailed information like website, hours, and ratings). This provides the best of both worlds: privacy-focused native search with comprehensive business details.

## üîë Google Places API Setup

### Step 1: Get Google Places API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Places API** for your project:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
   - Search for "Places API"
   - Click on "Places API" and enable it
4. Create an API key:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
   - Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Secure Your API Key (Recommended)

1. **Restrict the API key** in Google Cloud Console:
   - Click on your API key in the credentials page
   - Under "Application restrictions", select "iOS apps"
   - Add your app's bundle identifier (e.g., `com.yourcompany.calndr`)
   - Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key" and choose "Places API"

### Step 3: Add API Key to iOS Project

Add the API key to your app's `Info.plist`:

```xml
<!-- Add this to ios/calndr/calndr/Info.plist -->
<key>GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit your actual API key to version control. Consider using environment variables or build configurations for different environments.

## üöÄ Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add Enhanced Search Manager to Xcode
1. Add `EnhancedSchoolSearchManager.swift` to your Xcode project
2. Ensure it's added to your target

### Step 2: Update Info.plist
```xml
<key>GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY</key>
<string>YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE</string>
```

### Step 3: Build and Test
The enhanced search will automatically:
1. Use MapKit to find schools (fast, privacy-focused)
2. When user selects a school, enhance it with Google data
3. Display enhanced information in the schools list

## üéØ How It Works

### Search Flow:
1. **MapKit Search**: Finds schools using native iOS search
   - Fast and privacy-focused
   - No API usage costs
   - Provides: name, address, phone number, distance

2. **User Selection**: When user chooses a school to add

3. **Google Enhancement**: Automatically looks up additional details
   - Uses Google Places API
   - Provides: website, business hours, ratings
   - Shows loading indicator during enhancement

4. **Final Result**: School saved with complete information

### API Usage Optimization:
- **No bulk enhancement**: Only enhances schools that users actually select
- **Coordinate matching**: Ensures Google result matches MapKit result (500m radius)
- **Graceful fallback**: If Google enhancement fails, saves with MapKit data
- **Error handling**: Continues working even without API key

## üîß Features

### MapKit Provides:
- ‚úÖ School name
- ‚úÖ Full address
- ‚úÖ Phone number (when available)
- ‚úÖ Distance from search point
- ‚úÖ Coordinates

### Google Places API Adds:
- ‚úÖ Website URL
- ‚úÖ Business hours (formatted)
- ‚úÖ User ratings (1-5 stars)
- ‚úÖ Price level information
- ‚úÖ Verified Google Place ID

### Enhanced School Card Features:
- **Clickable phone numbers** (opens phone app)
- **Clickable websites** (opens Safari)
- **Formatted business hours** (multi-line display)
- **Star ratings** (visual rating display)
- **Complete address** (from MapKit)

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Google Places API Pricing:
- **Find Place from Text**: $0.017 per request
- **Place Details**: $0.017 per request
- **Total per school enhancement**: ~$0.034

### Cost Optimization:
- Only enhances schools when user selects them (not during search)
- Typical usage: 1-5 schools enhanced per user session
- Monthly costs for small apps: $1-10 depending on usage

### Free Tier:
- Google provides $200 monthly credit
- Covers ~5,800 school enhancements per month
- More than sufficient for most apps

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No enhancement happening**:
   - Check if `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is in Info.plist
   - Verify API key is valid in Google Cloud Console
   - Check Xcode console for error messages

2. **"API key not available" in logs**:
   - Ensure key is added to Info.plist with correct name
   - Clean build and rebuild project

3. **Google API errors**:
   - Check if Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
   - Verify API key restrictions allow your app
   - Check quota limits in Google Cloud Console

4. **Schools found but no Google data**:
   - Normal for some schools (not all are in Google Places)
   - Check coordinate matching (must be within 500m)
   - Some schools may not have complete Google business profiles

### Debug Tips:

Enable detailed logging to see the enhancement process:
```swift
// Check console for these log messages:
// ‚úÖ Enhanced school 'School Name' with Google data
// ‚ùå Failed to enhance school 'School Name': error details
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Places API key not available - skipping enhancement
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Privacy Benefits:
- **MapKit**: No data sent to third parties during search
- **Google**: Only used when user actively selects a school
- **Minimal data**: Only school name and coordinates sent to Google

### Security Best Practices:
- Restrict API key to your iOS app bundle ID
- Use environment-specific API keys for dev/prod
- Monitor API usage in Google Cloud Console
- Never expose API keys in client-side code repositories

## üìã Testing Checklist

- [ ] Google Places API enabled in Cloud Console
- [ ] API key added to Info.plist
- [ ] API key restrictions configured (bundle ID + Places API)
- [ ] Project builds without errors
