# School Section Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete school section implementation that mirrors the daycare functionality.

## üè´ What Was Implemented

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models (`backend/db/models.py`)
- **school_providers** table - Stores school information (name, address, contact details, etc.)
- **school_calendar_syncs** table - Tracks calendar synchronization for schools

#### 2. API Schemas (`backend/schemas/school.py`)
- `SchoolProviderCreate` - For creating/updating school providers
- `SchoolProviderResponse` - For API responses
- `SchoolSearchRequest` - For searching schools via Google Places API
- `SchoolSearchResult` - For search results

#### 3. API Endpoints (`backend/api/v1/endpoints/school_providers.py`)
- `GET /api/school-providers` - List all school providers for family
- `POST /api/school-providers` - Create new school provider
- `PUT /api/school-providers/{provider_id}` - Update school provider
- `DELETE /api/school-providers/{provider_id}` - Delete school provider
- `GET /api/school-providers/{provider_id}/discover-calendar` - Auto-discover calendar URL
- `POST /api/school-providers/{provider_id}/parse-events` - Parse and sync calendar events
- `POST /api/school-providers/search` - Search for schools using Google Places API

#### 4. Services (`backend/services/school_events_service.py`)
Enhanced existing service with:
- `discover_calendar_url()` - Automatically find school calendar URLs
- `parse_events_from_url()` - Extract events from school websites
- `get_school_events()` - Process and store school events
- `get_all_school_events()` - Complete workflow for school calendar integration

#### 5. API Integration (`backend/api/v1/api.py`)
- Added school_providers router to the main API

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Settings Modal Enhancement (`vue-app/frontend/src/components/SettingsModal.vue`)
Added two new tabs:
- **Schools Tab** - Complete school provider management interface
- **Daycare Tab** - Dedicated daycare provider management interface

#### 2. Calendar Integration (`vue-app/frontend/src/components/Calendar.vue`)
- Updated school events toggle button label from "Daycare" to "School"
- Maintained existing school events display functionality

#### 3. Provider Management Features
Both school and daycare tabs include:
- List view of existing providers
- Add/Edit forms with validation
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Calendar sync capabilities
- Search integration with Google Places API
- Responsive design with proper styling

### Database Migration

#### Migration Script (`migrate_school_providers.py`)
- Creates `school_providers` table with proper constraints
- Creates `school_calendar_syncs` table for tracking syncs
- Adds indexes for performance optimization
- Includes update triggers for automatic timestamp management

## üéØ Key Features

### Technical Implementation
1. **Scalable Architecture** - Follows existing patterns and conventions
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript/Pydantic schema validation
3. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. **Performance** - Optimized database queries with proper indexing
5. **Security** - Proper authentication and family-level data isolation

## üìä API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/school-providers` | Get all school providers for family |
| POST | `/api/school-providers` | Create new school provider |

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

### school_providers Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `family_id` - Links to families table
- `name` - School name
- `address` - School address
- `phone_number` - Contact phone
- `email` - Contact email
- `hours` - Operating hours
- `notes` - Additional notes
- `google_place_id` - Google Places ID
- `rating` - School rating
- `website` - School website
- `created_by_user_id` - Creator reference
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - Timestamps

### school_calendar_syncs Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `school_provider_id` - Links to school_providers
- `calendar_url` - Source calendar URL
- `last_sync_at` - Last sync timestamp
- `last_sync_success` - Success status
- `last_sync_error` - Error message if failed
- `events_count` - Number of events synced
- `sync_enabled` - Whether sync is active

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Administrators
1. Run the migration script: `python migrate_school_providers.py`
2. Restart the backend server
3. The new endpoints will be available immediately

### For Users
1. Open the app and go to Settings
2. Navigate to the "Schools" tab
3. Add school providers manually or search for local schools
4. Sync calendars to import school events and closures
5. View school events on the main calendar with the school toggle

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Systems

The school section seamlessly integrates with:
- **Calendar Display** - School events appear alongside other calendar items
- **Settings Management** - Uses existing modal and navigation patterns
- **Authentication** - Inherits family-level security model
- **Theming** - Adapts to user's selected theme
- **Notifications** - Can integrate with existing notification system

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. **Bulk Import** - Import multiple schools from CSV/Excel
2. **Advanced Search** - Filter by school type, ratings, distance
3. **Event Categories** - Categorize different types of school events
4. **Notifications** - Push notifications for school closure announcements
5. **Shared Calendars** - Share school calendars between families
6. **API Webhooks** - Real-time updates when school calendars change

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready school management system that perfectly mirrors the daycare functionality while maintaining the app's existing architecture and design patterns.
