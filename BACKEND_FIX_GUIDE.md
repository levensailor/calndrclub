# Backend Refactoring Guide

The app has been successfully refactored from a monolithic `app.py` to a modular backend structure.

## ✅ Refactoring Complete!

The backend refactoring is now complete. All endpoints have been migrated to the modular structure.

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Run the Original App (Legacy - Still Works)

```bash
# From the root directory
./run.sh
```

### Option 2: Run the Refactored Backend (Recommended)

```bash
# From the root directory
./run.sh backend
```

This will:
- Navigate to the backend directory
- Set up the correct PYTHONPATH
- Run the refactored backend on port 3000

## What Was Completed

### 1. **Project Structure**
```
backend/
├── api/v1/endpoints/     # All API endpoints
├── core/                 # Core functionality
├── db/                   # Database models
├── schemas/              # Pydantic schemas
├── services/             # Business logic
└── main.py              # Application entry
```

### 2. **All Endpoints Implemented**
- ✅ Authentication (`/api/auth`)
- ✅ Users (`/api/users`)
- ✅ Family (`/api/family`)
- ✅ Events (`/api/events`)
- ✅ Custody (`/api/custody`)
- ✅ Notifications (`/api/notifications`)
- ✅ Profile (`/api/user/profile`)
- ✅ Reminders (`/api/reminders`)
- ✅ Babysitters (`/api/babysitters`)
- ✅ Emergency Contacts (`/api/emergency-contacts`)
- ✅ Group Chat (`/api/group-chat`)
- ✅ Children (`/api/children`)
- ✅ Daycare Providers (`/api/daycare-providers`)
- ✅ Weather (`/api/weather`)
- ✅ School Events (`/api/school-events`)
- ✅ Themes (`/api/themes`)

### 3. **Features Preserved**
- JWT authentication
- AWS SNS push notifications
- Weather caching
- School events scraping
- S3 profile photo uploads
- Google Places daycare search
- All database operations

## Deployment

The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) deploys the refactored backend. The server setup script (`backend/setup-backend.sh`) handles the Python path correctly on the server.

## Benefits of the Refactored Structure

1. **Modular Design**: Each endpoint has its own module
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Easier Testing**: Individual modules can be tested independently
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new endpoints
5. **Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand and modify
6. **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic schema validation
7. **API Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger/ReDoc docs
