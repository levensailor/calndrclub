# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the Calndr Backend project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.21] - 2025-01-10 12:40:00 EST

### Fixed - Critical Database Parameter Binding Error in Custody Endpoints
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved TypeError in database.fetch_all() method calls preventing custody data access
  - **Problem**: PostgreSQL-style parameter placeholders ($1, $2, $3) incompatible with databases library
  - **Solution**: Changed to named parameters (:family_id, :start_date, :end_date) with dictionary binding
  - **Impact**: Fixed 500 Internal Server Error when iOS app fetches custody calendar data
  - **Affected Endpoints**: get_custody_records_optimized(), get_custody_records_handoff_only(), get_performance_stats()
  - **Root Cause**: Parameter binding mismatch causing "takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 5 were given"
  - **Result**: All custody functionality restored in new container deployment (calndr-staging:8)

## [2.0.20] - 2025-01-10 00:49:00 EST

  - **Error Recovery**: Highlights containers that fail and get automatically replaced by ECS
  - **Toast Notifications**: Immediate user feedback for all container lifecycle events
  - **Event History**: Maintains last 20 container events with timestamps and task IDs
  - **Faster Polling**: Enhanced monitoring with 15-second ECS status updates
  - **Perfect for**: Debugging container stability, monitoring deployments, tracking restart patterns

## [2.0.19] - 2025-01-10 00:25:00 EST

### Enhanced - CloudWatch Log Viewer v2.0 with ECS Container Management
- **🚀 Major Feature**: Enhanced CloudWatch Log Viewer with comprehensive ECS container management

## [2.0.18] - 2025-01-09 23:59:00 EST

### Fixed - 405 Method Not Allowed for Custody PUT Requests
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved FastAPI route pattern conflict causing 405 errors for custody updates
  - Route conflict: Generic `/{year}/{month}` was matching specific `/date/{custody_date}` patterns
  - FastAPI interpreted `/date/2025-09-03` as year="date", month="2025-09-03" 
  - Since generic route only supported GET method, PUT requests returned 405 Method Not Allowed
  - **Solution**: Moved specific routes (POST /, PUT /date/{date}) to top of file before generic routes
  - FastAPI now matches specific patterns first, preventing conflicts
  - Fixes iOS app unable to update custody records with proper error handling
  - Also fixes OPTIONS preflight requests for CORS that were failing with 405

## [2.0.17] - 2025-01-09 23:30:00 EST

### Fixed - Container Log Buffering in CloudWatch
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved Python/Gunicorn log buffering preventing real-time logs in CloudWatch
  - Added Gunicorn flags: `--log-level info`, `--capture-output`, `--enable-stdio-inheritance`
  - Added `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` environment variable for proper log encoding
  - Logs now appear immediately in CloudWatch instead of being buffered until container restart
  - Essential for real-time troubleshooting and monitoring in ECS staging environment
  - Works in conjunction with the new CloudWatch Log Viewer tool for optimal debugging experience

## [2.0.7] - 2025-01-26 18:45:00 EST

### Fixed - Database Subnet Routing Infrastructure
- **🛣️ Database Route Tables**: Fixed missing route tables and associations for database subnets
  - Added `aws_route_table.database` resources for proper subnet routing
  - Added `aws_route_table_association.database` to connect database subnets to route tables
  - Database subnets were previously using default VPC route table causing connectivity issues
- **⚙️ Configurable Database Internet Access**: Added optional internet access for database maintenance
  - New variable `enable_database_internet_access` to control NAT gateway routing
  - Staging environment: Enabled for maintenance access (`enable_database_internet_access = true`)
  - Production environment: Disabled for security (`enable_database_internet_access = false`)
- **📊 Enhanced Network Outputs**: Added comprehensive network infrastructure outputs
  - Internet Gateway ID, NAT Gateway IDs, Database Route Table IDs

- **🔧 Database Routing Fix Script**: Created `fix-database-routing.sh` for easy deployment
  - Targeted Terraform apply for database routing resources only
  - Interactive script with confirmation and environment selection
  - Clear instructions for next steps after applying fixes

### Root Cause Analysis
The RDS database was deployed in database subnets that lacked proper route tables and associations. Without explicit route tables, the database subnets were using the default VPC route table, which doesn't have the necessary routing configuration for proper connectivity between ECS tasks in private subnets and the database in database subnets.

### Infrastructure Impact
- **Database Connectivity**: ECS tasks in private subnets can now properly reach RDS database
- **Security**: Production database subnets remain isolated without internet access
- **Maintenance**: Staging environment allows controlled internet access for maintenance operations
- **Network Isolation**: Proper subnet segregation between public, private, and database tiers

## [2.0.6] - 2025-01-26 18:30:00 EST

### Fixed - Redis Library Python 3.11 Compatibility Issue
- **🔧 Redis Library Update**: Fixed `TypeError: duplicate base class TimeoutError` in Python 3.11
  - Replaced `aioredis>=2.0.1` with `redis>=5.0.0` which has proper Python 3.11 support
  - Updated Redis service to use `redis.asyncio` instead of the problematic `aioredis` library
  - Changed connection method from URL-based to parameter-based configuration
- **🔗 Connection Method Update**: Updated Redis connection initialization in `redis_service.py`
  - Changed from `aioredis.from_url()` to `redis.Redis(**connection_kwargs)`
  - Updated disconnect method from `close()` to `aclose()` for async Redis client
  - Improved connection parameter handling for password authentication
- **🛡️ Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved Redis connection resilience in `main.py`
  - Added Redis ping test after successful connection
  - Enhanced logging for Redis connection status
  - Application continues gracefully without Redis if connection fails

### Root Cause Analysis
The error `TypeError: duplicate base class TimeoutError` occurred because in Python 3.11, `asyncio.TimeoutError` became an alias for `builtins.TimeoutError`. The older `aioredis` library tried to inherit from both, causing a duplicate base class error. The newer `redis` library with async support resolves this compatibility issue.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-01-26 18:15:00 EST

### Fixed - Database URL Special Character Encoding Issue
- **🔧 URL Encoding Fix**: Fixed "Invalid IPv6 URL" error caused by special characters in database password
  - Added proper URL encoding using `urllib.parse.quote_plus()` for database credentials
  - Database passwords containing `[`, `]`, `!`, `@`, and other special characters are now properly encoded
  - Updated `core/config.py` to encode both username and password in DATABASE_URL construction
- **🔍 Enhanced URL Debugging**: Improved database configuration logging to show URL encoding details
  - Shows detection of special characters in passwords
  - Displays both raw (unencoded) and final (encoded) DATABASE_URL for comparison
  - Added URL parsing success confirmation
- **🧪 Updated Test Script**: Enhanced `test_db_connection.py` to validate URL encoding functionality
  - Detects and logs special character presence in passwords
  - Shows before/after URL encoding lengths for verification

### Root Cause Analysis
The error `ValueError: Invalid IPv6 URL` was caused by square brackets `[` and `]` in the database password `MChksLq[i2W4OEkxAC8dPKVNzPpaNgI!`. URL parsers interpret square brackets as IPv6 address delimiters, causing the parsing to fail. The fix properly URL-encodes these characters (`[` becomes `%5B`, `]` becomes `%5D`) before URL construction.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-01-26 18:00:00 EST
