## [2.0.27] - 2025-01-10 20:56:00 EST

### Fixed - Events Endpoint Transaction Abort from Missing Database View
- **🔧 Critical Database Fix**: Resolved events API transaction abort errors from non-existent database view dependency
  - **Problem**: Events endpoints querying non-existent 'family_all_events' database view causing transaction aborts
  - **Symptom**: First query fails → transaction aborts → fallback query runs on aborted connection → 'current transaction is aborted' errors
  - **Impact**: 400 Bad Request responses breaking iOS app events functionality, middleware reporting 'Malformed request' errors
  - **Root Cause**: Missing database view + poor error handling allowing transaction contamination between query attempts
  - **Solution**: Removed dependency on missing view, direct events table query with proper transaction isolation
  - **Transaction Management**: Single clean transaction per endpoint eliminating connection state contamination
  - **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP 500 responses instead of transaction abort scenarios
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained frontend-compatible event data structure for iOS app
  - **Performance**: Cleaner query path without unnecessary view lookup attempts
  - **Result**: Events API restored with reliable transaction management eliminating abort scenarios

## [2.0.26] - 2025-01-10 15:18:00 EST

### Fixed - Database Concurrency Bottleneck from Transaction Over-Use
- **🔧 Critical Performance Fix**: Resolved "another operation is in progress" database concurrency errors
  - **Problem**: Unnecessary transaction wrapping on simple read operations causing connection pool exhaustion
  - **Symptom**: High-frequency get_current_user() calls (every authenticated request) wrapped in transactions blocking concurrent operations
  - **Root Cause**: Connection pool too small (5 connections) + transaction overhead holding connections exclusively
  - **Still Async**: No change to async database architecture (databases + asyncpg) - purely a configuration optimization
  - **Solution**: Removed transaction wrapping from simple SELECT operations, reserved for multi-step operations only
  - **Enhanced Retry**: Added retry logic for transient database errors with exponential backoff (0.1s * attempt)
  - **Increased Pool**: Expanded connection pool from 5 to 15 connections for concurrent authentication load
  - **Smart Transaction Usage**: Transaction management only where atomicity is required (auth endpoints with multiple operations)
  - **Impact**: Restored high-performance concurrent authentication eliminating connection pool contention
  - **Result**: Database concurrency bottlenecks eliminated with proper async connection management

## [2.0.25] - 2025-01-10 14:55:00 EST

### Fixed - Comprehensive PostgreSQL Transaction Management in All Authentication Endpoints
- **🔧 Critical System-Wide Fix**: Resolved PostgreSQL transaction abort errors by implementing comprehensive transaction management across all authentication endpoints
  - **Problem**: Multiple authentication endpoints performing sequential database operations without transaction management causing connection pool contamination
  - **Affected Operations**: User login, registration, Google OAuth (callback & iOS), Apple auth - all performing multi-step database operations
  - **Root Cause**: Any failed authentication operation leaving connections in aborted transaction state affecting subsequent get_current_user calls throughout the system  
  - **Comprehensive Solution**: Wrapped ALL authentication database operations in explicit transactions using 'async with database.transaction()'
  - **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added specific database error logging while preserving HTTP exception behavior (401, 409)
  - **Transaction Isolation**: Ensures atomicity for multi-step operations (user creation, family creation, updates) with automatic rollback
  - **Connection Pool Health**: Prevents transaction state contamination between requests through proper cleanup
  - **Impact**: Complete elimination of PostgreSQL transaction abort errors system-wide with robust authentication reliability
  - **Result**: Authentication operations now fully isolated with automatic transaction cleanup preventing connection pool corruption

## [2.0.24] - 2025-01-10 14:00:00 EST

### Fixed - PostgreSQL Transaction Abort Error in User Authentication  
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved PostgreSQL "current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block" errors
  - **Problem**: Database operations using implicit transactions without proper error handling causing authentication failures
  - **Symptoms**: Random 401 authentication errors, cascade 504 Gateway Timeout errors, database connection pool issues
  - **Root Cause**: get_current_user() function lacked explicit transaction management and retry logic for PostgreSQL transaction abort scenarios
  - **Solution**: Added explicit transaction wrapping using 'async with database.transaction()' and retry logic (3 attempts max)
  - **Error Detection**: Specific handling for PostgreSQL transaction abort error pattern with automatic recovery
  - **Connection Recovery**: Proper transaction cleanup and connection state recovery for connection pool health
  - **Impact**: Robust authentication with automatic transaction error recovery eliminating random auth failures
  - **Result**: Authentication reliability restored with graceful handling of PostgreSQL transaction state issues

## [2.0.23] - 2025-01-10 13:39:00 EST

### Fixed - Redis Cache Delete Operations Hanging Causing 504 Custody Update Timeouts
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved Redis delete operations hanging without timeout protection during custody updates
  - **Problem**: Cache invalidation operations hanging indefinitely on slow Redis responses after successful database updates
  - **Symptoms**: Custody toggles working once but failing on subsequent attempts, 504 Gateway Timeout errors
  - **Root Cause**: Redis delete() method lacked timeout protection unlike get() method causing infinite hangs
  - **Solution**: Added 2-second timeout to Redis delete operations using asyncio.wait_for() 
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Cache invalidation failures no longer block successful database updates
  - **Impact**: Custody updates now complete reliably in <1 second with proper cache management
  - **Result**: iOS app custody toggle functionality restored with consistent performance

## [2.0.22] - 2025-01-10 13:32:00 EST

### Fixed - Google OAuth Timeout Causing 504 Gateway Timeout Errors
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved Google iOS login timing out after 30+ seconds causing 504 errors
  - **Problem**: Google token verification making slow external calls to fetch public keys without timeout
  - **Solution**: Added 20-second timeout protection for Google's id_token.verify_oauth2_token()
  - **Implementation**: Wrapped synchronous Google API call in async executor with asyncio.wait_for()
  - **Error Handling**: Specific timeout exceptions with user-friendly error messages
  - **Impact**: Google OAuth authentication now fails fast instead of hanging indefinitely
  - **User Experience**: Clear "service temporarily unavailable" message vs generic 504 timeout
  - **Result**: iOS users can authenticate reliably even during Google service slowdowns

## [2.0.21] - 2025-01-10 12:40:00 EST

### Fixed - Critical Database Parameter Binding Error in Custody Endpoints
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved TypeError in database.fetch_all() method calls preventing custody data access
  - **Problem**: PostgreSQL-style parameter placeholders ($1, $2, $3) incompatible with databases library
  - **Solution**: Changed to named parameters (:family_id, :start_date, :end_date) with dictionary binding
  - **Impact**: Fixed 500 Internal Server Error when iOS app fetches custody calendar data
  - **Affected Endpoints**: get_custody_records_optimized(), get_custody_records_handoff_only(), get_performance_stats()
  - **Root Cause**: Parameter binding mismatch causing "takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 5 were given"
  - **Result**: All custody functionality restored in new container deployment (calndr-staging:8)

## [2.0.18] - 2025-01-09 23:59:00 EST

### Fixed - 405 Method Not Allowed for Custody PUT Requests
- **🔧 Critical Fix**: Resolved FastAPI route pattern conflict causing 405 errors for custody updates
  - Route conflict: Generic `/{year}/{month}` was matching specific `/date/{custody_date}` patterns
  - FastAPI interpreted `/date/2025-09-03` as year="date", month="2025-09-03" 
  - Since generic route only supported GET method, PUT requests returned 405 Method Not Allowed
  - **Solution**: Moved specific routes (POST /, PUT /date/{date}) to top of file before generic routes
  - FastAPI now matches specific patterns first, preventing conflicts
  - Fixes iOS app unable to update custody records with proper error handling
  - Also fixes OPTIONS preflight requests for CORS that were failing with 405

## [2.0.17] - 2025-01-09 23:30:00 EST

### Root Cause Analysis
The RDS database was deployed in database subnets that lacked proper route tables and associations. Without explicit route tables, the database subnets were using the default VPC route table, which doesn't have the necessary routing configuration for proper connectivity between ECS tasks in private subnets and the database in database subnets.

### Infrastructure Impact
- **Database Connectivity**: ECS tasks in private subnets can now properly reach RDS database
- **Security**: Production database subnets remain isolated without internet access
- **Maintenance**: Staging environment allows controlled internet access for maintenance operations
- **Network Isolation**: Proper subnet segregation between public, private, and database tiers

## [2.0.6] - 2025-01-26 18:30:00 EST

### Fixed - Redis Library Python 3.11 Compatibility Issue
- **🔧 Redis Library Update**: Fixed `TypeError: duplicate base class TimeoutError` in Python 3.11
  - Replaced `aioredis>=2.0.1` with `redis>=5.0.0` which has proper Python 3.11 support
  - Updated Redis service to use `redis.asyncio` instead of the problematic `aioredis` library
  - Changed connection method from URL-based to parameter-based configuration
- **🔗 Connection Method Update**: Updated Redis connection initialization in `redis_service.py`
  - Changed from `aioredis.from_url()` to `redis.Redis(**connection_kwargs)`
  - Updated disconnect method from `close()` to `aclose()` for async Redis client
  - Improved connection parameter handling for password authentication
- **🛡️ Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved Redis connection resilience in `main.py`
  - Added Redis ping test after successful connection
  - Enhanced logging for Redis connection status
  - Application continues gracefully without Redis if connection fails

### Root Cause Analysis
The error `TypeError: duplicate base class TimeoutError` occurred because in Python 3.11, `asyncio.TimeoutError` became an alias for `builtins.TimeoutError`. The older `aioredis` library tried to inherit from both, causing a duplicate base class error. The newer `redis` library with async support resolves this compatibility issue.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-01-26 18:15:00 EST

### Fixed - Database URL Special Character Encoding Issue
- **🔧 URL Encoding Fix**: Fixed "Invalid IPv6 URL" error caused by special characters in database password
  - Added proper URL encoding using `urllib.parse.quote_plus()` for database credentials
  - Database passwords containing `[`, `]`, `!`, `@`, and other special characters are now properly encoded
  - Updated `core/config.py` to encode both username and password in DATABASE_URL construction
- **🔍 Enhanced URL Debugging**: Improved database configuration logging to show URL encoding details
  - Shows detection of special characters in passwords
  - Displays both raw (unencoded) and final (encoded) DATABASE_URL for comparison
  - Added URL parsing success confirmation
- **🧪 Updated Test Script**: Enhanced `test_db_connection.py` to validate URL encoding functionality
  - Detects and logs special character presence in passwords
  - Shows before/after URL encoding lengths for verification

### Root Cause Analysis
The error `ValueError: Invalid IPv6 URL` was caused by square brackets `[` and `]` in the database password `MChksLq[i2W4OEkxAC8dPKVNzPpaNgI!`. URL parsers interpret square brackets as IPv6 address delimiters, causing the parsing to fail. The fix properly URL-encodes these characters (`[` becomes `%5B`, `]` becomes `%5D`) before URL construction.
