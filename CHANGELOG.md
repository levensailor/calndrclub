# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the Calndr Backend project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.6] - 2025-01-26 18:30:00 EST

### Fixed - Redis Library Python 3.11 Compatibility Issue
- **🔧 Redis Library Update**: Fixed `TypeError: duplicate base class TimeoutError` in Python 3.11
  - Replaced `aioredis>=2.0.1` with `redis>=5.0.0` which has proper Python 3.11 support
  - Updated Redis service to use `redis.asyncio` instead of the problematic `aioredis` library
  - Changed connection method from URL-based to parameter-based configuration
- **🔗 Connection Method Update**: Updated Redis connection initialization in `redis_service.py`
  - Changed from `aioredis.from_url()` to `redis.Redis(**connection_kwargs)`
  - Updated disconnect method from `close()` to `aclose()` for async Redis client
  - Improved connection parameter handling for password authentication
- **🛡️ Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved Redis connection resilience in `main.py`
  - Added Redis ping test after successful connection
  - Enhanced logging for Redis connection status
  - Application continues gracefully without Redis if connection fails

### Root Cause Analysis
The error `TypeError: duplicate base class TimeoutError` occurred because in Python 3.11, `asyncio.TimeoutError` became an alias for `builtins.TimeoutError`. The older `aioredis` library tried to inherit from both, causing a duplicate base class error. The newer `redis` library with async support resolves this compatibility issue.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-01-26 18:15:00 EST

### Fixed - Database URL Special Character Encoding Issue
- **🔧 URL Encoding Fix**: Fixed "Invalid IPv6 URL" error caused by special characters in database password
  - Added proper URL encoding using `urllib.parse.quote_plus()` for database credentials
  - Database passwords containing `[`, `]`, `!`, `@`, and other special characters are now properly encoded
  - Updated `core/config.py` to encode both username and password in DATABASE_URL construction
- **🔍 Enhanced URL Debugging**: Improved database configuration logging to show URL encoding details
  - Shows detection of special characters in passwords
  - Displays both raw (unencoded) and final (encoded) DATABASE_URL for comparison
  - Added URL parsing success confirmation
- **🧪 Updated Test Script**: Enhanced `test_db_connection.py` to validate URL encoding functionality
  - Detects and logs special character presence in passwords
  - Shows before/after URL encoding lengths for verification

### Root Cause Analysis
The error `ValueError: Invalid IPv6 URL` was caused by square brackets `[` and `]` in the database password `MChksLq[i2W4OEkxAC8dPKVNzPpaNgI!`. URL parsers interpret square brackets as IPv6 address delimiters, causing the parsing to fail. The fix properly URL-encodes these characters (`[` becomes `%5B`, `]` becomes `%5D`) before URL construction.
